# UdemyJavaMasterClass

A collection of solutions to coding exercises from Tim Buchalka’s excellent “Java Master Class” from Udemy.

I wish to freely share the code in this repository, using the terms of the GNU General Public License in the license.md file at the root of this repository.

Most of this work is my own.  However,several of the math-intensive exercises from the “control-flow” section of the course are based on the examples provided by Michal Kasiarz at https://github.com/michalkasiarz, including:
* FactorPrinter.java
* FlourPacker.java
* LargestPrime.java
* ThePrimeNumberChallenge.java
* NumberPalindrome.java

To complete the above exercises I’ve borrowed some of his algorithms and taken guidance from his code.  While I’ve made some changes to his algorithms, I wish to acknowledge my debt to *il miglior fabbro*, the better craftsman. I hope that other students will benefit from my code as I have from his.
